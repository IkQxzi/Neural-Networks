A **neural network** built **from scratch** in **Python**, using only necessary libraries like Numpy & Cupy - without all the bells and whistles of others like TensorFlow & Keras.
To do this, I plan to **learn the underlying concepts** from videos like [this series by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks). I also will take some inspiration from [this book](https://nnfs.io/) by Sentdex. I _could_ simply follow along with the book, but I wish to **understand the theory** enough to create a network **on my own.**
The **end goal** here is to create a **facial recognition network** which integrates with my computer's camera to provide a **'Face ID'-like biometric authentication.**

**To achieve this, I look to reach these distinct milestones:**
1. Create a functional dense network to classify handwritten digits (the "Hello World" of machine learning), using only numpy.
2. Optimise said network to use CUDA, a more sophisticated optimiser, and any other key performance-improving techniques.
3. Use the framework developed to create a facial recognition network (I know convolutional networks are more suited to this purpose, we will see if it can be done with a dense network).
4. Integrate the network with the camera to allow me to unlock my computer using only my face.

To help others who wish to undertake the daunting task of becoming proficient in machine learning, I will **add to this documentation** - covering aspects such as: 
- the **justifications** behind conventional **activation** and **loss functions,**
- the **intuitions** behind **backpropogation** & **gradient descent,**
- the **applications** for neural networks (and machine learning in general).

Check back here in future if you wish to follow along, or maybe just learn something interesting!
